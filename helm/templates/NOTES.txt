app has been installed.
{{ if .Values.app.ingress.enabled }}
To use it, go to <https://{{ .Values.host }}>.
{{ else }}
To be able to access it, set up an ingress or access the service directly by
running the following command:

    kubectl port-forward --namespace={{ .Release.Namespace }} \
      service/{{ .Release.Name }}-app 8080:80
{{ if ne "localhost" .Values.host }}
As you set your host value to {{ .Values.host }}, make sure that it resolves to
the localhost IP address, e.g. by adding the following two lines to /etc/hosts:

    ::1       {{ .Values.host }}
    127.0.0.1 {{ .Values.host }}
{{ end }}
To access app, go to <http://{{ .Values.host }}:8080>.
{{ end }}
